# fileCompression

As the name suggest this is about file compression ie, using certain algorithms and methods we reduce the size of the file which can retain more or less all the data  so that 
storing and transfer become easy when they are expensive.

## Run Length Encoding 

This is one of the easiest encoding technique because we just replace  no of time a character repeated consecutively with a number and character for instance 

WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWWW is replaced with 
12W1B12W3B24W1B14W
